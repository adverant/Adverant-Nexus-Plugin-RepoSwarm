# Microservices Architecture Analysis

## Objective
Analyze the microservices architecture patterns and inter-service communication.

## Focus Areas

### 1. Service Boundaries
- Domain separation clarity
- Service cohesion
- Coupling between services
- Shared code/libraries

### 2. Communication Patterns
- Sync vs async communication
- Message queue usage

### 3. Data Management
- Database per service pattern
- Shared database anti-pattern
- Event sourcing
- CQRS patterns

### 4. Resilience
- Retry policies
- Fallback mechanisms
- Bulkhead patterns
- Health check endpoints

### 5. Observability
- Distributed tracing
- Correlation IDs
- Centralized logging
- Metrics collection

## Output Format
Provide architectural assessment with diagrams in mermaid format.
